# Dust

Dust is template framework for JAX-RS built on top of [RESTEasy](http://www.jboss.org/resteasy) and [Guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/). Dust is component oriented and fully namespace aware. Every component and page belongs to a namespace which is used together with a name to uniquely identify the page and/or component. Templates are written in XML and are mapped to components at runtime.
