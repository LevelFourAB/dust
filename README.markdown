# Dust

Dust is template and web framework for Java, providing a way to build modular
sites and web apps. Dust is built on-top of JAX-RS using [RESTEasy](http://www.jboss.org/resteasy)
and [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice).

Dust is component oriented and fully namespace aware. Every component and page
belongs to a namespace which is used together with a name to uniquely identify
the page and/or component. Templates are written in XML and are mapped to
components at runtime.
